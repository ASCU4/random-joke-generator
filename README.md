Random Joke Generator Web Application

This project is a random joke generator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I created this project to strengthen my frontend development fundamentals, especially working with JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and user interactions.

The idea for this project was randomly found on YouTube. I thought it was a great concept to try building on my own. While the overall implementation is done by me, I used a similar color design because I really liked the combination and how clean it looks.
